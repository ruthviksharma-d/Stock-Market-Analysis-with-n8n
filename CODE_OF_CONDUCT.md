- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct
- Suspend or ban individuals from the project and community for behavior deemed unacceptable
- Communicate decisions and rationale to affected parties where appropriate

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include:

- Project repositories, issue trackers, mailing lists, discussion forums, chat rooms, and social media channels
- Public events and conference talks where the individual is representing the project
- Any other online or offline spaces where behavior can affect the project or its contributors

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible. You may report incidents by:

- Opening a private GitHub issue addressed to the maintainers (if your report can remain private), or
- Contacting the maintainers directly via email: [REPLACE WITH MAINTAINER EMAIL]

When reporting, please include as much of the following as you are comfortable sharing:

- Your name and contact information (optional; you can report anonymously)
- A description of the incident, including dates, times, and places
- Any relevant screenshots, URLs, or copies of messages
- The names of any people involved (if known)
- How you would like the maintainers to respond

All reports will be handled with discretion to protect the privacy of the reporter and others involved.

## Enforcement Process

When a report is received, maintainers will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within a reasonable timeframe.
2. Assess the situation and, if necessary, gather additional information from relevant parties.
3. Determine an appropriate course of action, which may include:
   - A private warning to the offender
   - Temporary or permanent removal of contributor privileges
   - Referral to platform or legal authorities if the situation warrants
4. Inform the reporter (when possible) of the outcome or steps taken, subject to privacy and confidentiality constraints.

Decisions will be made at the maintainers' discretion and with the goal of protecting the community and preserving an inclusive environment.
